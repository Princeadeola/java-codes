Typecasting is the assessment of the value of one primitive data type
to another type. In java, there are two types of casting namely upcasting
and downcasting as follows:


Upcasting is casting a subtype to a super type in an upward direction to
the inheritance tree. It is an automatic procedure for which there are no
efforts poured in to do so where a sub-class object is referred by a superclass
reference variable. One can relate it with dynamic polymorphism.


Downcasting refers to the procedure when subclass type refers to the object of
the parent class is known as downcasting. If it is performed directly compiler
gives an error as ClassCastException is thrown at runtime. It is only achievable
with the use of instanceof operator The object which is already upcast, that object
only can be performed downcast.
