Variables in Java
Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during Java program
execution. Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity
of value it can hold. Variable is a memory location name of the data.
A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.


-The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
-A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on
the variable effects that memory location.
-In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.

Java Methods
A method is a block of code that performs a specific task.

In Java, there are two types of methods:
-User-defined Methods: We can create our own method based on our requirements.
-Standard Library Methods: These are built-in methods in Java that are available to use.

Java Object
A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. Each object
has an identity, a behavior and a state.

The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions)
display the object's behavior. Objects are created at runtime from templates, which
are also known as classes.
