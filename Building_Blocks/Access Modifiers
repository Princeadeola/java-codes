These are called the non access specifiers

static:	The member belongs to the class, not to objects of that class.

final: Variable values can't be changed once assigned, methods can't be
overriden, classes can't be inherited.

abstract: If applied to a method - has to be implemented in a subclass,
if applied to a class - contains abstract methods

synchronized: Controls thread access to a block/method.

volatile: The variable value is always read from the main memory, not from a
specific thread's memory.

transient: The member is skipped when serializing an object
