Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

Operators in Java are the special type of tokens in Java which when coupled with
entities such as variables or constants or datatypes result in a specific operation such
as addition, multiplication or even shifting of bits.

Types of Operators

Arithmetic Operators in Java

Java Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic operations.
There are mainly 5 Arithmetic Operators in Java.
a. Addition(+)
b. Multiplication(*)
c. Subtraction(-)
d. Division(/)
e. Mod2ulo(%)

Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used in Java to assign values to variables.

There are the following types of assignment operators
a. += This returns left=left+right
b. -= This returns left=left-right
c. *= This returns left=left*right
d. /= This returns left=left/right
e. %=This returns left=left%right


Comparison Operators in Java

Java comparison Operators are used to check the relation between values or variables.
The output of relational operators is always a boolean value. Comparison operators are
used by if conditions and for loop constraints.

Examples:-

a. <(Less than) -returns true if left entity lesser than right entity
b. >(Greater than)- returns true if left entity greater than right entity.
c. <=(Less than or equal to)- returns true if the left entity is smaller than or equal
to right entity.
d. >=(Greater than or equal to)- returns true if left variable is greater than or equal
 to right entity
e. ==(equals to) – returns true if the left and the right entities are equal
f. !=(not equals to) – returns true if left and right entities are not equal.



Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is true or false.
They are used in decision making.

a. Logical AND in Java

b. Logical OR in Java



Unary Operators

Unary operators are used with only one operand. For example, ++ is a unary operator
that increases the value of a variable by 1. That is, ++4 will return 5.
